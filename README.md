DPWH Project Monitoring System
A Capstone Project

This system was developed as a completed capstone project and formally presented to the Faculty of the Computer Communication Development Institute, Sorsogon City. It was designed specifically for the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) â€“ District 2, Sorsogon, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of project tracking and reporting.

The primary objectives of this capstone project were as follows:
- To develop a project profiling system tailored for DPWH District 2, Sorsogon, enabling comprehensive recording of project details.
- To create a real-time tracking system that monitors the progress and status of ongoing infrastructure projects.
- To generate detailed reports that provide insights into project timelines, accomplishments, and issues.
- To evaluate, test, and deploy the developed system for practical use by DPWH personnel.

This system offers a centralized platform that enhances transparency, accountability, and data management for public infrastructure initiatives, ultimately supporting better decision-making and resource allocation within the district.
